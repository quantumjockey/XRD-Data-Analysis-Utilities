XRD Data Analysis Utilities
===========================

An application (in JavaFX) for viewing MAR Tiff data, tracking changes between samples, and calculating X-Ray Diffraction patterns for selected groups.

This project has three purposes:

1.  To create effective, modern software that will replace antiquated tools currently in use by the mineralogical community.
2.  To construct a set of tools to help me execute the goals of my Master's Thesis project.
3.  To learn Java and the patterns recommended by Oracle and the Java developer community for use with JavaFX applications in a production environment.

Though the tool is in a useful state right now, a myriad of features (and documentation) will be added over the course of the next few weeks.

Note that this project currently has two dependencies:

1. filesystemhelper
2. mvvmhelper

Be sure to clone these repositories and reconfigure the application's project structure prior to working with the code.

Stay tuned for updates!
