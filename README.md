# XRD Data Analysis Utilities

An application (in JavaFX) for viewing MAR Tiff data, tracking changes between samples, and calculating X-Ray Diffraction patterns for selected groups.

This project has three purposes:

1.  To create effective, modern software that will replace antiquated tools currently in use by the mineralogical community.
2.  To construct a set of tools to help me execute the goals of my Master's Thesis project.
3.  To learn Java and the patterns recommended by Oracle and the Java developer community for use with JavaFX applications in a production environment.

Though the tool is in a useful state right now, a myriad of features (and documentation) will be added over the course of the next few weeks.

# Requirements

In order to begin development with this repository, the JDK and the latest release for Java 8 should be installed on your machine.

If the JDK and/or Java 8 is/are not installed on your machine:

1.  Go to the [Java SE Development Kit 8 page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) on Oracle's website
2.  Read/accept the [Oracle binary Code License Agreement for Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html)
3.  Select the version that best suits your OS/development environment and click on the file link to download it
4.  Open the installer you downloaded and follow all instructions/prompts until Java 8 and the JDK are installed on your machine

Your development environment is now ready for Java.
